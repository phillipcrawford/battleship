# Battleship

##Learning Competencies

* Model a simple real-world system in Ruby code

##Summary

 Build an interactive command-line game of Battleship! The full rules are on [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_\(game\)), but here's an abridged version from [Samuel Bednar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Battleships_Paper_Game.svg):

1. Each player has two 10x10 boards with columns labeled 1-10 and rows labeled A-J, one labeled "Your Ships" to represent their own ships and one to represent their opponent's board, labeled "Enemy Ships."
2. Each player arranges their ships on their own board, see the fleet table below.
3. Take turns firing a salvo at your opponent, calling out squares as "A3", "B6", etc. A salvo is the number of shots equal to the number of ships you have left.
4. Mark salvos fired on the "Enemy Ships" grid (`/` marks a miss, i.e. water; `X` marks a hit). You must call out when your ship is sunk completely.

### Fleet table

| #  | Ship             | Size |
| -- | ---------------- | ---- |
| 1x | Aircraft carrier | 5    |
| 1x | Battleship       | 4    |
| 1x | Cruiser          | 3    |
| 2x | Destroyer        | 2    |
| 2x | Submarine        | 1    |

##Releases

###Release 0 : Setting up the environment

- User plays against the computer.
- When starting a new game, each player should have two empty boards: 'HOME' and 'ENEMY'.
- User should be able to determine the position of ships on their 'HOME' board OR the computer should seed the board with the ships pre-positioned.
- Start with a fleet of just 5 ships, one of each type.

###Release 1 :  Determining gameplay

- The game starts with user firing a salvo (a series of shots) at their opponent's (the computer's) ships.
- The number of shots in a salvo is equal to the number of unsunk ships in a player's fleet.
- After a salvo is fired, the user is notified of hits and misses on their 'ENEMY' board.

###Release 2 :  Winning the game

- The user should be notified when they have sunk one of their opponent's ships.
- When the user has sunk all of their opponent's ships, they win the game.

###Release 3 :  Refactoring

Refactor your code. Some questions to ask yourself:

- Is it DRY?
- Are the methods and variables appropriately named?
- Does it utilize appropriate data structures?
- Is there proper commenting?
- Is it concise and comprehensible?

###Release 4 : Add features (optional)

- Fleet has 7 ships, adding both a submarine and a destroyer.
- User can play against another user.
- Computer can play against itself.
- Computer is somewhat intelligent (i.e. it knows to cluster shots near a hit until a ship is sunk).
